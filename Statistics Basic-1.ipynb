    "Answer = Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It provides methods for making inferences and decisions in the presence of uncertainty. The primary goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data and to make informed decisions based on that information."

    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. It provides a snapshot of the main features of a dataset.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you have collected data on the heights of students in a school. Descriptive statistics would include measures like the average height, the most common height (mode), the middle height (median), the range of heights, and the variation around the average (standard deviation). Graphical representations like a histogram or a box plot can also be used to visually summarize the data.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Inferential statistics involve using data from a sample to make inferences or predictions about a population. It allows researchers to draw conclusions that go beyond the specific data they have collected.\n",
    "Example: Consider a scenario where a pharmaceutical company wants to test the effectiveness of a new drug. They might conduct a clinical trial with a sample of patients and use inferential statistics to make predictions about how the drug would perform in the larger population. This could involve hypothesis testing to determine if the drug has a significant effect compared to a placebo, or confidence interval estimation to quantify the uncertainty around the effectiveness of the drug.\n"
